This meeting is the first meeting. Aim of the meeting is to plan our project.

There are 2 ways to work
* **Start from scatch**. This will make sure that you are familiar with the data and be able to play with it. Importantly, you will understand the whole process. Nothing will influence and blocks your ideas.
* **Build on top of others**. It is much easier. Good for starter but you will not fully understand how it works, why and how to consider a certain options.

@Kenny: He shared his experiences when he joined his last Kaggle competition.
  * It follows the 2nd approach. Start from a baseline and add up more features. 
  * Tuning parameters and try new ideas can work in parallel

## Conclusion
* Find 2-3 days starts looking at the data and try to build a simple model by yourself
* Then, spend another 2-3 days to gather other ideas

## Tasks
* Summery your findings and show your own model
* Summery other ideas (as a list):
	* What techniques they used?
	* Why it is good/bad?
	* Accuracy
	* One suggestion to improve

## Next meeting
Next Sunday; 12/04/2020
