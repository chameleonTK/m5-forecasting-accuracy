#### Findings:
* In general
  * couldn't run that amount of data to make prediction in local machine. We could choose either
  notebook from Kaggle or Google Lab, either of them works.
  * no need to use 10-fold cross-validation but 5-fold is used in the baseline to reduce overfitting
* Four directions for building models:
  * one model to predict one-day result, so there will be 28 models. **No prediction will be added 
  as a feature to the next prediction**
  * one model to predict one-day result, but the previous precdition will be added a feature for 
  the next prediction
  * one model for one-item prediction, meaning we need to split the data based on kinds of items 
  first, and train each kind of items with one model.
  * one model for all days as shown in baseline
  
#### Plans:
* data will be split into two chunks based on days: 1-1903 and 1904-1913, the latter chunk will be 
used as a testing set for internal test.
* Trello will be used as a teamwork tool instead of github.
* Both will do feature engineering and model exploration at the same time, but Tk will take exploring
models as a priority, and Kenny will take feature engineering as a priority.
